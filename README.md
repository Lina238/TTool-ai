</p>

ðŸŒ² TTool-AI is developed at the [**Laboratory for Timber Construction**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/) (director: Prof.Yves Weinand) with the support of the [**EPFL Center for Imaging**](https://imaging.epfl.ch/), at [**EPFL**](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Lausanne, Switzerland. The project is part of the [**Augmented Carpentry Research**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/augmented-carpentry/).


ðŸ¤– TTool-AI automates the integration of new tools into AC (Augmented Carpentry), enhancing efficiency and simplifying the process. It is developed in Python and relies on the [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework. The project is containerized with [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) and [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). The Training Service is based on [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/). The project is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) with NVIDIA GPUs.

## Getting Started

### For Users:
1. **Go to the specified URL**:

Visit the EPFL server at: http://128.178.91.106:16666/docs

2. **Follow the instructions**:

Check out our [Wiki for Users](https://github.com/ibois-epfl/TTool-ai/wiki/TTool%E2%80%90ai-Guide-for-user) for more details.


### For Developers (server-side):

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**:

    Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system with **NVIDIA Runtime support** for the Training Service.

2. **Environment Variables**:
    TTool-AI relies on environment variables defined in a **.env file**. 
    Make sure to set up this file as per the project's requirements. 

    **Important**: The .env file that is included in the repository is tailored for the EPFL server. You might have to modify the values for **${DATA_DIR}**, **${VIDEO_DIR}** and **${POSTGRES_DIR}** to match your system's directory structure.

3. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ibois-epfl/TTool-ai.git
    ```

4. **Run the project**:
    Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    cd TTool-ai/
    ```
    Run Docker Compose to build the project in the foreground:
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

5. **Access the Service**:

Once everything is up and running, you can access the FastAPI interface at:
- If built on localhost: http://localhost:16666/docs
- If built on a remote server: Use the appropriate IP address.

    For more details, check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/ibois-epfl/TTool-ai/wiki).

## Caveats

For now the server can be accessed only by EPFL users via VPN.
We are planning to make the server accessible from outside the EPFL domaine.
