# TTool-AI

ðŸŒ² TTool-AI is developed at the [**Laboratory for Timber Construction**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/) (director: Prof.Yves Weinand) with the support of the [**EPFL Center for Imaging**](https://imaging.epfl.ch/), at [**EPFL**](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Lausanne, Switzerland. The project is part of the [**Augmented Carpentry Research**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/augmented-carpentry/).


ðŸ¤– TTool-AI automates the integration of new tools into AC (Augmented Carpentry), enhancing efficiency and simplifying the process. It is developed in Python and relies on the [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework. The project is containerized with [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) and [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). The Training Service is based on [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/). The project is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) with NVIDIA GPUs.
